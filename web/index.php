  <h3 class="underline uppercase">What is Siftr?</h3>
  <p>Siftr is a citizen science app that allows you to create projects for any topic, from biology and ecology to photography and language studies. Participants will use your Siftr project to go out into the field and collect data.</p>
  <p>How does it work? With Siftr, you can design and share a citizen science project in about five minutes. Your participants will download the Siftr app. Then they can start collecting data from the field. Siftr automatically creates a webpage with a map visualizing your project data. Use the comment section for online discussion. The map visualization is great for sharing your findings in a group setting.
